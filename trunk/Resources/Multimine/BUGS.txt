BUG 11.
Some people cannot send chat messages properly.
If that's the case, then all your chat messages will appear as
"Your computer cannot get the text from the message box. Sorry you cannot chat"

BUG 12.
There is one report that one person cannot connect to any other servers that aren't on his computer. I haven't begun to figure that one out.

BUG 13.
On the computers at my work, running Windows 2003, when starting a server it doesn't let you and comes back with the message below. just hold down the Enter key until the server begins correctly.

Could not start the server, this only happens on ICMS computers.

This doesn't happen on my 2003 virtual machine.
Keep trying by holding down the ENTER key until it finally works.
If it doesn't after a minute of trying, give up. I told you this game was great!

BUG 14.
I noticed when I was playing that while the timer stops after the game is over, it doesn't reset when the next game starts.
